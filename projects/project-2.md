# Description
“De olho em manaus” is a mobile application that I created in 2017. The project helped me learn more how about design and implements in mobile system.

This project was implemented in Android. During the project I created a webservice hosted in AmazonWS that is where the data is consumed through JSON. After 1 year I changed to Firebase and now I don't neet to use AmazonWS anymore. 

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web / mobile application design and associated technologies.
