# Drescription
"De olho em manaus" is a mobile application that I create, started in 2017. The project helped me learn more how to design and implement in mobile.

This project is implemented in Android. During the project I created a webservice hosted in AmazonaWS that  is where the data is consumed through JSON.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web / mobile application design and associated technologies.

# Project Structure
