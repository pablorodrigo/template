# Description
Sigwpl is a web application that I have been creating and developing since 2016 in HelpAmazon company. This project controls the sectors of a vessel company for example: maintenance, finances, reports and others.

The project has helped me to learn how to design and implement a responsive web site using [PrimeFaces](https://www.primefaces.org/showcase/index.xhtml).

I have been working in the entire process of developing i.e.:
 - Collect requirements; 
 - Planning;
 - prototyping;
 - Implementation; 
 - Testing;
 - Deployment.

With this project I gained experience in full-stack web application and project management.

# Project Structure
Been using MVC design pattern (Model-View-Controller)
