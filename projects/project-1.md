# Drescription
Sigwpl is a web application that I've helped to create since 2016 in the HelpAmazon company. This project controls the sectors of a vessel company for example: maintenance, financial, officials and others.

The project helped me learn more how to design and implement a responsive web site even using [PrimeFaces](https://www.primefaces.org/showcase/index.xhtml).

I work in the entire process of developing for example: 
 - Collect requirements; 
 - Planning;
 - prototyping;
 - Implementation; 
 - Testing;
 - Deployment

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application and project management.

# Project Structure
Being used MVC design pattern (Model-View-Controller)
